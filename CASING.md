# Kilnin' It - Enclosure Design & Ceramic Front Panel

This document covers the standalone "pet computer" style enclosure design and the unique ceramic front panel fabrication process.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Standalone Desktop Case Concept

The Kilnin' It controller uses a **standalone desktop enclosure** rather than a panel-mount design integrated into the kiln itself. This approach is inspired by vintage computers from the 1970s and 1980s (Commodore PET, Apple II, TRS-80, IBM PC) and provides significant advantages:

**Safety & Practicality**:
- ✅ Heat isolation - Controller stays away from hot kiln
- ✅ No kiln modifications required - Kiln remains stock
- ✅ Portable - Move between kilns, studios, demonstrations
- ✅ Safe distance - User doesn't interact with controls near hot kiln surface

**User Experience**:
- ✅ Ergonomic positioning - Sit comfortably at desk while monitoring
- ✅ Better viewing angles - Position and tilt as needed
- ✅ Safer interaction - No risk of burns while adjusting settings

**Aesthetic Appeal**:
- ✅ Retro computer charm - Instant nostalgia factor
- ✅ Conversation starter - Unique appearance stands out
- ✅ Maker credibility - Shows craftsmanship and attention to design
- ✅ Market differentiation - Unique look for Tindie/small-scale sales

**Manufacturing Benefits**:
- ✅ Easier case design - More forgiving dimensions than panel-mount
- ✅ Off-the-shelf options available - Hammond, Bud Industries cases
- ✅ Better cooling - Room for vents, optional fan, proper airflow
- ✅ Easy maintenance - Access panels for repairs and upgrades

## Ceramic Front Panel (Signature Feature)

### Concept

The front panel of the Kilnin' It controller is made from **fired ceramic**—wheel-thrown, glazed, and fired to Cone 6 using the controller itself. This creates a unique meta-narrative: a kiln controller with a front panel made by the kiln it controls.

**Why This is Brilliant**:
- 🎨 **Poetic perfection** - Controller made BY the process it controls
- 🎨 **Aesthetic uniqueness** - No two panels are exactly alike (glaze variations)
- 🎨 **Marketing gold** - "The only kiln controller with a ceramic front panel"
- 🎨 **Community connection** - Speaks directly to ceramic artists
- 🎨 **Proof of concept** - Shows trust in your own product

### Material Selection

**Clay Body Options**:

| Type | Firing Temp | Properties | Cost | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|------------|------|----------------|
| **Stoneware** | Cone 6 (1220°C) | Durable, low porosity, many glaze options | $$ | ✅ Best choice |
| **Porcelain** | Cone 6-10 | Smooth, white, premium appearance | $$$ | Premium version |
| **Earthenware** | Cone 04 (950°C) | Easier to fire, more fragile | $ | Not recommended |

**Recommended**: **Cone 6 stoneware** - excellent durability, versatile glazing, strong enough for handling

### Panel Specifications

**Dimensions** (example for 6" x 8" enclosure):
- **Target size (fired)**: 150mm x 200mm x 6mm thick
- **Pre-firing size** (with 12% shrinkage): 170mm x 227mm x 7mm
- **Weight**: ~200-300g (fired stoneware)

**Required Features**:
- LCD window cutout (rectangular, sized for display)
- Two encoder shaft holes (8-10mm diameter)
- Three LED holes (5-6mm diameter)

## 3D-Printed Ceramic Tooling

### Production Method

To make ceramic panels **repeatable and scalable**, use 3D-printed tools as cookie cutters and embossing stamps.

**Tool Components**:

**1. Cutting Frame**:
- Cookie-cutter style with sharp edges
- Cuts panel outline and all openings (LCD, encoders, LEDs)
- Height: 15-20mm (tall enough to grip and press through clay)
- Tapered walls for clean cuts (2mm top, 0.8mm cutting edge)

**2. Embossing Plate**:
- Raised text and graphics (1-2mm height)
- Features: "KILNIN' IT" logo, knob labels, decorative elements
- Registration pins for alignment with cutting frame
- Reversed/mirrored (reads correctly when pressed into clay)

**3. Registration System**:
- Alignment pins or guides
- Ensures consistent placement every time
- Visual alignment marks

### Design Considerations

#### Shrinkage Compensation

Clay shrinks 10-15% during firing (varies by clay body). **Test your specific clay first!**

**Example calculation** (assuming 12% shrinkage):
- Target fired size: 150mm wide
- Calculation: 150mm ÷ 0.88 = 170mm
- **Cutter dimensions: 170mm** (pre-firing)

**All features must be scaled up**:
- LCD window: 102mm x 57mm (target 90mm x 50mm fired)
- Encoder holes: 10.5mm (target 9mm fired, includes clearance)
- LED holes: 6.5mm (target 5.5mm fired, includes clearance)

#### Cutter Edge Design

**Sharp cutting edge**:
- Taper outer walls to 45° angle (knife-edge)
- Wall thickness: 2mm at top, 0.8-1mm at cutting edge
- Too thin = breaks during printing
- Too thick = won't cut cleanly through clay

**Internal supports**:
- Bridge large openings (LCD window) with thin (1mm) ribs
- Prevents warping during 3D print
- Creates "tabs" in clay that you trim after cutting

#### Embossing Plate Design

**Text & Graphics**:
- Raised features: 1-2mm height (pressed into clay surface)
- Minimum feature size: 1.5mm (thinner won't print well or will collapse in clay)
- Font choice: Bold, simple fonts (avoid thin serifs)
- **Mirror all text** (reads correctly when impressed into clay)

**Example embossed layout**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   K I L N I N '   I T       │ ← Logo (raised 2mm, mirrored)
│                             │
│  ⚙  ⚙  ⚙                    │ ← Decorative elements (gears, circuits)
│                             │
│ NAVIGATE        ADJUST      │ ← Knob labels (raised 1.5mm, mirrored)
│                             │
│  ●  ●  ●                    │ ← LED position markers
│ PWR WIFI ERR                │ ← LED labels (raised 1.5mm, mirrored)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Registration features**:
- Corner alignment pins (5mm diameter x 10mm tall)
- Visual alignment marks on embosser perimeter
- Full frame outline matching cutter (optional)

### 3D Printing Settings

#### Filament Selection

| Filament | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **PLA** | Easy to print, rigid, sharp edges | Can warp with moisture over time | Prototyping, testing |
| **PETG** | Water-resistant, durable, some flex | Harder to achieve sharp edges | Embosser, production use |
| **ABS** | Very durable, rigid | Requires heated enclosure, warps easily | Long-term production cutter |
| **Nylon** | Extremely tough, flexible | Absorbs moisture, difficult to print | Heavy-duty production (100+ uses) |

**Recommendations**:
- **Prototyping**: PLA (fast, easy, cheap)
- **Production** (10+ panels): PETG or ABS (durable, water-resistant)

#### Print Settings

**Cutter Frame**:
- Layer height: 0.2mm (good detail, reasonable speed)
- Perimeters/walls: 3-4 (strong walls for cutting pressure)
- Infill: 20-30% (strength without excess weight)
- Top/bottom layers: 4-5 (solid surfaces)
- Supports: Enable for any overhangs

**Embossing Plate**:
- Layer height: 0.15mm (fine detail for crisp text)
- Perimeters: 3
- Infill: 15-20% (adequate strength)
- Top layers: 6-8 (solid embossing surface, no infill showing)
- Supports: Minimal (design to avoid if possible)

## Ceramic Panel Fabrication Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Clay Preparation**:
```
Roll slab → Cut to rough size → Ensure even thickness (7mm) →
Let rest 10-15 minutes (prevents warping)
```

Use slab roller with guides or rolling pins with guide sticks to ensure even thickness.

**2. Cutting**:
- Place cutter on fresh clay slab
- Press down firmly and evenly (use acrylic sheet on top to distribute pressure)
- Rock gently to ensure full cut through clay
- Lift cutter straight up
- Remove excess clay (reclaim for next batch)

**3. Embossing**:
- Align embosser using registration pins/marks
- Press firmly and evenly (use roller or press if available)
- Hold pressure for 5-10 seconds
- Lift carefully at an angle (prevents dragging/smearing)

**4. Cleanup**:
- Use damp sponge to smooth cut edges
- Check all holes are clean and free of burrs
- Use needle tool to clean corners and tight spaces
- Verify panel is flat (place on flat surface, check for rocking)

**5. Drying** (CRITICAL - prevents warping):
- Place on flat plaster bat or drywall sheet (absorbs moisture evenly)
- Cover loosely with plastic sheet (slows drying, prevents cracking)
- Flip panel every 12 hours (ensures even drying, prevents warping)
- Dry to "leather hard" stage before handling (firm but carveable)
- Full drying time: 3-5 days (depends on humidity and thickness)

**6. Bisque Firing**:
- Ensure panels are completely dry (bone dry, no cool spots)
- Load onto kiln shelves with even support
- Fire to Cone 04 (1060°C) - standard bisque temperature
- Slow heating through water smoking phase (up to 200°C)
- Cool completely before unloading

**7. Glazing**:
- Apply glaze to front surface (brush, dip, or spray)
- Avoid glaze on back surface and mounting hole areas
- Optional: Wax resist around edges and holes (prevents glaze adhesion)
- Optional: Underglaze details (fill embossed text with contrasting color, wipe excess)

**8. Glaze Firing**:
- Load glazed panels onto kiln shelves (use stilts or kiln wash to prevent sticking)
- **Fire using your Kilnin' It controller!** (meta moment)
- Fire to Cone 6 (1220°C) - standard stoneware temperature
- Document the firing (time-lapse video, data logging, web dashboard screenshots)
- Cool slowly to prevent thermal shock
- Unload when kiln is below 100°C

**9. Post-Firing**:
- Inspect for cracks, chips, glaze defects
- Sand back surface if needed (silicon carbide sandpaper, wet sanding)
- Drill mounting holes in corners (diamond drill bits, wet drilling, slow speed)
- Clean panel thoroughly (remove dust)
- Polish glazed surface if desired

### Drying Strategy (Preventing Warps)

**Critical success factors**:
- ✅ Even slab thickness (use rolling guides)
- ✅ Slow, even drying (plastic cover, plaster bat)
- ✅ Regular flipping (every 12 hours)
- ✅ Flat support surface (plaster, drywall, smooth board)
- ✅ Optional: Light weight on top (board + 1-2 lbs weight)

**Signs of problems**:
- ⚠️ Edges drying faster than center → cover edges with damp cloth
- ⚠️ Panel warping upward → flip immediately, place weight
- ⚠️ Cracks forming → drying too fast, increase humidity (mist plastic cover)

### Quality Control Checklist

**After glaze firing, verify**:
- [ ] Dimensions within ±1mm of target (measure with calipers)
- [ ] No warping (place on flat surface, check for rocking)
- [ ] All holes clean, correct size, and drillable
- [ ] Embossed text legible and crisp
- [ ] Glaze application even (no bare spots, no excessive drips)
- [ ] No cracks, chips, or structural defects
- [ ] LCD fits in window with 1-2mm clearance on all sides
- [ ] Encoder shafts fit through holes (test with actual encoders)
- [ ] LEDs fit through holes (test with actual LEDs)
- [ ] Corner mounting holes positioned correctly (test with case)

## Batch Production Workflow

Once the process is dialed in, efficient batch production is possible:

### Week 1: Fabrication

**Saturday Morning** (1-2 hours active work):
- Roll 3-5 clay slabs to even thickness
- Cut all panels using 3D-printed cutter
- Emboss all panels using stamp
- Clean edges and openings
- Place on drying boards, cover with plastic

**Week 1-2: Passive Drying**:
- Flip panels daily
- Monitor for warping (adjust weights/humidity as needed)
- Wait for bone-dry state (7-10 days depending on conditions)

### Week 2: Bisque Firing

**Saturday** (30 minutes active work + firing time):
- Load dry panels into kiln (can stack on shelves with posts)
- Program bisque firing profile (Cone 04, slow ramp)
- Start firing
- Monitor via web dashboard
- Unload next day when cool

### Week 3: Glazing & Glaze Firing

**Saturday Morning** (1-2 hours active work):
- Apply glaze to bisque panels (brush or dip)
- Optional: Add underglaze details to embossed areas
- Let glaze dry (1-2 hours)
- Load into kiln on shelves with stilts
- **Program glaze firing using Kilnin' It controller** (meta moment!)
- Document the firing process (time-lapse, screenshots, social media content)

**Sunday**:
- Unload fired panels
- Inspect quality
- Drill mounting holes with diamond bits
- Clean and prepare for assembly

### Week 4: Final Assembly

**Result**: 3-5 finished ceramic panels ready for controller assembly

**Total active time**: ~5-7 hours spread over 3-4 weeks (mostly passive waiting)

---

## Assembly Integration

### Mounting the Ceramic Panel

**Layered construction** (front to back):

```
1. Ceramic panel (6mm thick)
2. Thin foam gasket (1-2mm) - protects LCD from ceramic, absorbs stress
3. 3D-printed or laser-cut mounting bracket (holds LCD, PCB)
4. LCD module (secured to bracket with screws/clips)
5. Main PCB with ESP32 and components
6. Back panel of enclosure
```

**Securing the ceramic panel**:
- M3 or M4 screws through corner mounting holes
- Nylon or metal standoffs/spacers (6-10mm height)
- Rubber or silicone grommets in screw holes (prevent stress cracks)
- **Never over-tighten** - ceramic cracks under point stress (snug, not tight)
- Use washers to distribute load

**Component alignment**:
- LCD window: Position LCD so screen is centered in ceramic window, with 1-2mm clearance
- Encoder shafts: Pass through ceramic holes, secure with nuts on back side
- LEDs: Press-fit or glue LEDs into ceramic holes from behind

### Alternative: Ceramic Inlay Panel

**If full ceramic front seems too risky**:

Use a **hybrid approach** with ceramic inlay:
- Main front panel: Laser-cut wood, acrylic, or aluminum
- Central area: Cutout for ceramic inlay/badge
- Ceramic piece: Smaller (4" x 6"), less warping risk
- Mount: Glue or screw ceramic inlay into cutout

**Advantages**:
- Retains ceramic aesthetic (signature feature)
- Easier to fabricate (smaller ceramic piece)
- Less warping risk (smaller size)
- Front panel provides structural support
- Can replace ceramic inlay if damaged

**Example layout**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Wood/Acrylic Front Panel   │
│  ┌───────────────────────┐  │
│  │                       │  │
│  │   Ceramic Inlay       │  │ ← Fired ceramic "badge/nameplate"
│  │   "KILNIN' IT"        │  │    (Glazed, embossed text)
│  │                       │  │
│  └───────────────────────┘  │
│                             │
│  [LCD]  [Knobs]  [LEDs]     │ ← Cut into wood/acrylic panel
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Cable Management

### Connections to Kiln

**Thermocouple Extension**:
- K-type thermocouple extension wire (rated to 200°C+)
- Length: 6-10 feet (2-3 meters) - adequate distance from kiln
- Connector: Mini connector or screw terminals at controller end (easy disconnect)
- Routing: Keep away from AC power lines (reduces electrical noise)

**SSR Control Cable**:
- 18 AWG 2-conductor cable (low voltage, low current)
- Length: 6-10 feet (2-3 meters)
- Connector: Screw terminals, barrel connector, or panel-mount connector
- Clearly labeled at both ends ("SSR CONTROL - LOW VOLTAGE")

**SSR Mounting Location**:
- **Mount SSR at or near the kiln** (NOT inside controller case)
- Keeps high-voltage AC wiring away from controller electronics
- Use adequate heat sink (SSRs generate heat during operation)
- Ensure proper ventilation around SSR

**AC Power to Kiln**:
- SSR switches hot wire between wall outlet and kiln
- Neutral and ground pass through directly (not switched)
- Use proper wire gauge (14 AWG minimum for 15A circuits)
- Follow local electrical codes

**Controller Power**:
- Separate 5V power supply for controller (USB or DC adapter)
- **Completely isolated from kiln AC power** (no shared ground)
- Can be powered from different outlet than kiln (reduces noise)

### Cable Organization

**At controller**:
- Strain relief for all cables entering back panel
- Cable glands or rubber grommets
- Label all connections clearly
- Consider using panel-mount connectors for clean look

**Cable routing**:
- Bundle thermocouple and SSR control cables together
- Keep separate from AC power cables (reduces EMI/noise)
- Use cable ties, spiral wrap, or braided sleeve
- Adequate service loop at both ends (allows movement/adjustment)

2. Paint underglaze into embossed/recessed areas (fills text)
3. Wipe excess with damp sponge (text stays colored, surface cleans)
4. Apply clear glaze over entire panel
5. Fire to Cone 6

**Result**: Colored text/graphics on contrasting background (e.g., white text on blue background)

### Illuminated Features

**Backlit ceramic** (advanced):
- Use translucent porcelain (very thin, 2-3mm)
- LEDs behind panel illuminate embossed areas
- Creates glowing text/graphics effect
- Requires: Precise thickness control, very thin ceramic, careful handling

### Interchangeable Panels

**Design enclosure with removable ceramic front**:
- Quick-release mounting system (clips or magnetic)
- User can swap panels for different aesthetics
- Sell additional panels separately ($25-35 each)
- Seasonal designs, limited editions, custom glazes

## Design Files & Resources

### CAD Design Guidelines

**Software options**:
- **Fusion 360** - Excellent parametric design, free for hobbyists
- **FreeCAD** - Open-source, fully capable
- **Tinkercad** - Simple, browser-based (good for beginners)
- **Blender** - Complex shapes, organic forms

**Design workflow**:
1. Measure actual components (LCD, encoders, LEDs) with calipers
2. Create 2D sketch of front panel layout
3. Determine fired ceramic dimensions (based on enclosure size)
4. Calculate pre-firing dimensions (add 12-15% for shrinkage)
5. Model cutter frame with tapered walls
6. Model embossing plate with mirrored text
7. Add registration features for alignment
8. Export as STL for 3D printing

**Design tips**:
- Parameterize shrinkage percentage (easy to adjust if clay body changes)
- Create separate files for cutter and embosser (easier to print/modify)
- Model test pieces (small versions to verify dimensions)
- Include version numbers in file names (cutter_v1.0.stl, embosser_v2.1.stl)

### Testing & Iteration

**Prototype workflow**:

**Version 1** - Dimension test:
- Print cutter in PLA (fast, cheap)
- Cut single panel from scrap clay
- Measure wet, leather-hard, dry, bisque, and glazed dimensions
- Calculate actual shrinkage percentage for your clay body
- Document findings

**Version 2** - Feature test:
- Scale cutter to compensate for measured shrinkage
- Add embossing plate
- Cut and emboss single panel
- Fire with glaze
- Test fit with actual LCD, encoders, LEDs
- Verify hole sizes, window dimensions, mounting hole placement

**Version 3** - Production version:
- Fine-tune any dimensions based on test fit
- Adjust embossing depth if needed (too shallow/too deep)
- Print in durable material (PETG or ABS)
- Cut batch of 3-5 panels
- Verify consistency across batch
- Document final specifications

### Documentation

**Record keeping** (for repeatability):
- Clay body brand and type
- Measured shrinkage percentage
- Glaze recipes or commercial glaze names
- Firing schedules (bisque and glaze)
- Tool dimensions (cutter and embosser)
- CAD file versions
- Photos of each iteration

**Instructional content** (for open-source release):
- Step-by-step fabrication guide with photos
- 3D-printable tool files (STL format)
- Recommended clay bodies and glazes
- Troubleshooting guide
- Video tutorials

## Failure Modes & Solutions

### Problem: Clay sticks inside cutter

**Causes**: Clay too wet, cutter surface rough, no release agent

**Solutions**:
- Dust cutter with cornstarch or potter's talc before use
- Spray with cooking oil or mold release (light coat)
- Clean cutter between uses (damp sponge, dry thoroughly)
- Ensure clay is proper consistency (firm but not too wet)

### Problem: Embossing smears or drags clay

**Causes**: Clay too wet, lifting embosser at angle, embosser details too fine

**Solutions**:
- Ensure clay is right consistency (not too wet or soft)
- Press straight down with even pressure
- Lift straight up without tilting or sliding
- Simplify embossing details (make features larger/bolder)

### Problem: Panel warps during drying

**Causes**: Uneven thickness, drying too fast, uneven support

**Solutions**:
- Roll slab with guides to ensure even thickness
- Dry more slowly (cover with plastic, slow air circulation)
- Flip panel every 12 hours during drying
- Use completely flat support surface (plaster bat, drywall)
- Place light weight on top (board + 1-2 lbs) if warping upward

### Problem: Cracks form during drying or firing

**Causes**: Drying too fast, uneven thickness, thermal shock, clay body issues

**Solutions**:
- Dry very slowly and evenly (plastic cover, high humidity)
- Ensure even thickness throughout panel
- Verify clay is completely dry before firing (bone dry, no cool spots)
- Use slow heating schedule through water smoking phase (up to 200°C)
- Check clay body is appropriate for slab work (some clays crack easily)

### Problem: Glaze runs into holes or onto back surface

**Causes**: Glaze too thick, over-application, inadequate masking

**Solutions**:
- Apply wax resist around all holes and edges before glazing
- Use proper glaze consistency (not too thin/runny)
- Avoid over-application (thin, even coats)
- Clean holes with damp sponge after glazing
- Fire with panel vertical (use stilts) so glaze doesn't pool

### Problem: Dimensions don't match after firing

**Causes**: Incorrect shrinkage calculation, clay body variation, uneven drying

**Solutions**:
- Always test shrinkage with actual clay body before production
- Use same clay body batch for consistency
- Ensure even drying (prevents differential shrinkage)
- Re-measure and adjust cutter dimensions if needed
- Keep detailed records of shrinkage for each clay body

### Problem: Ceramic panel cracks when mounted

**Causes**: Over-tightened screws, point stress, no stress relief

**Solutions**:
- **Never over-tighten mounting screws** (snug only, not tight)
- Use rubber or silicone grommets in mounting holes (absorb stress)
- Use washers to distribute load over larger area
- Add foam gasket between ceramic and components (absorbs stress)
- Test fit before final assembly (ensure holes align perfectly)

## Summary

### Why This Enclosure Design Works

**Standalone desktop case**:
- ✅ Safer (away from hot kiln)
- ✅ More ergonomic (comfortable viewing/interaction)
- ✅ Easier to build (forgiving dimensions)
- ✅ Better cooling (adequate ventilation)
- ✅ More portable (move between kilns/studios)

**Ceramic front panel**:
- ✅ Unique aesthetic (no other controller has this)
- ✅ Perfect for target market (ceramic artists)
- ✅ Tells compelling story (made by the kiln it controls)
- ✅ Repeatable production (3D-printed tooling)
- ✅ Customizable (glazes, textures, text)

**3D-printed tooling**:
- ✅ Low cost ($15-20 investment)
- ✅ Highly repeatable (consistent dimensions)
- ✅ Fast iteration (redesign and reprint quickly)
- ✅ Scalable (tools last for 100+ panels)

### Next Steps

**Immediate** (hardware prototype phase):
- Use temporary enclosure (cardboard, wood box, or simple case)
- Focus on testing electronics and wiring
- Document component placement and spacing

**Near-term** (after electronics are working):
- Design 3D-printable cutter and embosser
- Test ceramic panel fabrication (measure shrinkage, test fit)
- Iterate tool design based on test results
- Create batch of 3-5 panels for beta units

**Long-term** (production-ready):
- Finalize enclosure design (off-the-shelf or custom)
- Refine ceramic panel aesthetics (glaze selection, embossing details)
- Document complete fabrication process
- Create marketing materials (photos, videos, product descriptions)
